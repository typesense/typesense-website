# JOINs

Typesense supports JOINing documents from one or more collections based on a related column between them.

**Note:** Adding a reference field to an existing collection via alter operation is not yet supported.

## One-to-One relation

When you create a collection, you can create a field that connects a document to a field in another collection 
via the `reference` property. 

For example, we could connect a `books` collection to an `authors` collection by using the `id` field of the `authors` 
collection as a reference:

```json
{
  "name":  "books",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "title", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "author_id", "type": "string", "reference": "authors.id"}
  ]
}
```

When we search the `books` collection, we can fetch author fields from the `authors` collection via `include_fields`.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8108/multi_search" -X POST \
        -H "X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: ${TYPESENSE_API_KEY}" \
        -d '{
          "searches": [
            {
              "collection": "books",
              "include_fields": "$authors(first_name,last_name)",
              "q": "famous"
            }
          ]
        }'
```

By requesting the `first_name` and `last_name` via `$authors(first_name,last_name)`, the response contains an
`authors` object with the corresponding author information:

```json
{
  "document": {
    "id": "0",
    "title": "Famous Five",
    "author_id": "0",
    "authors": {
      "first_name": "Enid",
      "last_name": "Blyton"
    }
  }
}
```

To include all fields in the collection we should use an asterisk `*`:

```json
{
  "collection": "books",
  "include_fields": "$authors(*)",
  "q": "famous"
}
```

Let's say we want to query the `authors` collection and get the related books of all the authors that match the query. Since `books` collection has the reference field and we're searching on `authors` collection, we cannot simply specify `include_fields: $books(*)` to join the related documents. To achieve this we'll have to specify `filter_by` clause to join on a collection like this:

```json
{
  "collection": "authors",
  "q": "query",
  "filter_by": "$books(id: *)",
  "include_fields": "$books(*)",
}
```

`id:*` is a special filter that matches all the documents of a particular collection so when used in a join, it allows you to list all the related books of a particular author.

Fields of type `int32`, `int64`, and `string` can be used in the case of "one-to-one" reference, i.e. one document 
being related to exactly one reference document. Fields of type `int32[]`, `int64[]`, and `string[]` can be used in 
the case of multiple references, i.e. one document being related to zero or more documents in another collection.

## One-to-many relation

### Simple Example

For a simple example, let's suppose that we have a `orders` collection, and we want to keep track of different orders for each customer, 
i.e. each customer could have a number of different orders.

The schema of the `customers` collection will look like this

```json
{
  "name":  "customers",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "forename", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "surname", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "email", "type": "string"}
  ]
}
```

Let's create a `orders` collection that stores a order's details, and it will
also reference the corresponding user that placed it in the user collection.

```json
{
  "name":  "orders",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "total_price", "type": "float"},
    {"name": "initial_date", "type": "int64"},
    {"name": "accepted_date", "type": "int64", "optional": true},
    {"name": "completed_date", "type": "int64", "optional": true},
    {"name": "customer_id", "type": "string", "reference": "customers.id"}
  ] 
}
```

We can now search the `customers` collection, and filter for the orders for a particular customer from  
the `orders` collection via `filter_by`:

```json
{
    "q":"*",
    "collection":"customers",
    "filter_by":"$orders(customer_id:=customer_a)"
}
```

We can filter by other fields as well, like fetching customers with orders with a total price under `100`:

```json
{
    "q": "*",
    "collection": "customers",
    "filter_by": "$orders(total_price:<100)"
}
```

By default, the above queries will include all the fields from the referenced `orders` 
collection. To include only the `total_price` field from the referenced collection, you could do:

```json
{
  "include_fields": "$orders(total_price)" 
}
```

### Specialized Example

For a more specialized example, suppose that we have a `products` collection, and we want to offer personalized pricing for customers, 
i.e. each product would have a different price for every customer. The join feature comes handy here too.

The schema of the `products` collection will look like this

```json
{
  "name":  "products",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "product_id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "product_name", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "product_description", "type": "string"}
  ]
}
```

Let's create a `customer_product_prices` collection that stores a custom price for each customer, and it will
also reference the corresponding document in the product collection.

```json
{
  "name":  "customer_product_prices",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "customer_id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "custom_price", "type": "float"},
    {"name": "product_id", "type": "string", "reference": "products.product_id"}
  ] 
}
```

We can now search the `products` collection, and filter for the prices for a particular customer from  
the `customer_product_prices` collection via `filter_by`:

```json
{
    "q":"*",
    "collection":"products",
    "filter_by":"$customer_product_prices(customer_id:=customer_a)"
}
```

Want to fetch products with price under `100`? That's easy to do too.

```json
{
    "q": "*",
    "collection": "products",
    "filter_by": "$customer_product_prices(customer_id:=customer_a && custom_price:<100)"
}
```

Similarly with the [simpler example](#simple-example), you can include only the `custom_price` field from the referenced collection:

```json
{
  "include_fields": "$customer_product_prices(custom_price)" 
}
```

## Many-to-many relation

Consider a collection with documents that we want to provide access to users such that a document can be accessed by 
many users and a given user can access many documents.

To do this, we can create three collections: `documents`, `users` and `user_doc_access` with the following schemas:

```json lines

{
  "name":  "documents",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "title", "type": "string"}
    {"name": "content", "type": "string"}
  ]
}

{
  "name":  "users",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "username", "type": "string"}
  ]
}

{
  "name":  "user_doc_access",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "user_id", "type": "string", "reference": "users.id"},
    {"name": "document_id", "type": "string", "reference": "documents.id"},
  ]
}
```

To fetch all the documents accessible to a `user_a`, we can query this way:

```json
{
    "q": "*",
    "collection": "documents",
    "filter_by": "$user_doc_access(user_id:=user_a)"
}
```
To get the user ids that can access a particular document:

```json
{
    "q": "*",
    "collection": "documents",
    "query_by": "title",
    "filter_by": "$user_doc_access(id: *)",
    "include_fields": "$users(id) as user_identifier"
}
```

When the reference field is an array type(string[], int32[], int64[]) we always return the joined documents in an array even if a particular document has relation with only one document. Since `user_doc_access` collection has a singular reference field type, we will only return the joined documents in an array when it has relation with more than one documents. `strategy: nest_array` can be mentioned in `include_fields` to force Typesense to return the joined documents in an array regardless of their relation count. Check `Forcing nested array for joined fields` section [here](#merging-nesting-joined-fields).

## Sort by joined collection field

Following the `$JoinedCollectionName( ... )` convention, we can `sort_by` on a field that's present in the joined collection this way:

```json
{
  "sort_by": "$JoinedCollectionName( field_name:desc )"
}
```

Similarly, to specify an `_eval` operation using the joined collection's field:

```json
{
  "sort_by": "$JoinedCollectionName( _eval(field_name:foo):desc )"
}
```

## Merging / nesting joined fields

By default, when we join on a collection, the collection's fields are returned as a nested document.

For example, when we join the `books` collection with `authors` collection above, notice how the fields of the
`authors` collection appear as an object in the response document:

```json
{
  "document": {
    "id": "0",
    "title": "Famous Five",
    "author_id": "0",
    "authors": {
      "first_name": "Enid",
      "last_name": "Blyton"
    }
  }
}
```

We could instead make the fields of the `authors` collection be merged with the fields of the `books` document
by using the `merge` strategy:

```json
{
  "collection": "books",
  "include_fields": "$authors(*, strategy: merge)",
  "q": "famous"
}
```

The default behavior is `strategy: nest`.

#### Forcing nested array for joined fields

In a one-to-many join query, you might want the joined collection's fields to be always represented as an array of 
objects, even if there is only a single match.

For example, given the following authors and books:

```json lines
{"id": "0", ",first_name": "Enid", "last_name": "Blyton"}
{"id": "1", ",first_name": "JK", "last_name": "Rowling"}
```

```json lines
{"title": "Famous Five", "author_id": "0"}
{"title": "Secret Seven", "author_id": "0"}
{"title": "Harry Potter", "author_id": "1"}
```

When we query the `authors` collection and join on the `books` collection, like this:

```json
{
  "collection": "authors",
  "q": "*",
  "filter_by": "$books(id:*)",
  "include_fields": "$books(*)"
}
```

We might end up with the books being either a nested object or a nested array of objects, depending on whether there 
are 1 or more matched books for each author.

```json
[
  {
    "document": {
      "id": "1",
      "first_name": "JK",
      "last_name": "Rowling",
      "books": {
        "author_id": "1",
        "id": "2",
        "title": "Harry Potter"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "document": {
      "id": "0",
      "first_name": "Enid",
      "last_name": "Blyton",
      "books": [
        {
          "author_id": "0",
          "id": "0",
          "title": "Famous Five"
        },
        {
          "author_id": "0",
          "id": "1",
          "title": "Secret Seven"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

To always make the fields of the joined `books` collection be an array of objects, you can use the `nest_array` 
field merging strategy.

```json
{
  "collection": "authors",
  "q": "*",
  "filter_by": "$books(id:*)",
  "include_fields": "$books(*, strategy: nest_array)"
}
```

This will always return an array of objects for the fields of `books` collection.

```json
[
  {
    "document": {
      "id": "1",
      "first_name": "JK",
      "last_name": "Rowling",
      "books": [
        {
          "author_id": "1",
          "id": "2",
          "title": "Harry Potter"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "document": {
      "id": "0",
      "first_name": "Enid",
      "last_name": "Blyton",
      "books": [
        {
          "author_id": "0",
          "id": "0",
          "title": "Famous Five"
        },
        {
          "author_id": "0",
          "id": "1",
          "title": "Secret Seven"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

## Asynchronous references

You can use the `async_reference` option when creating reference fields. This allows documents to be indexed successfully even when the referenced document doesn't exist yet.

```json
{
  "name": "orders",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "product_id", "type": "string", "reference": "products.product_id", "optional": true, "async_reference": true}
  ]
}
```

By setting `async_reference: true`, documents will be indexed without returning the error:
```
Reference document having '...' not found in the collection '...'.
```

The resolution of references will happen automatically when the referenced documents get indexed later. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to index documents in an order different from their dependency relationships.

## References inside an object

Let's say there is an `object` field called `order` in a `orders` collection. We can make the order refer to a
product in a `products` collection like this:

```json
{
  "name": "orders",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "order", "type": "object"},
    {"name": "order.product_id", "type": "string", "reference": "products.id"}
  ]
}
```

Alternatively, if we had an array of `order` objects with each order object containing a reference, then
the type of the reference field would have to be an array as well.

```json
{
  "name": "orders",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "orders", "type": "object[]"},
    {"name": "orders.product_id", "type": "string[]", "reference": "products.id"}
  ]
}
```

## Using aliases with Joins

You can use a collection alias in a reference field definition. In the example below, `products` could be an alias:

```json
{"name": "product_id", "type": "string", "reference": "products.product_id"}
```

However, it's important to keep in mind that a collection's documents store the internal IDs of 
the referenced collection's documents. These internal IDs are sequential in nature and are assigned to documents based on 
the order in which they are indexed.

Therefore, it's **crucial** to treat the referenced collections as a group, i.e., if you intend to switch any one of the collections 
via an alias update, you must reindex all the related collections simultaneously. This will guarantee that the internal IDs 
remain in sync across all the collections involved in the join operation.

## Left Join

By default, Typesense performs inner join. To perform left join,

```json
{
  "filter_by": "id:* || $join_collection_name( <join_condition> )" 
}
```
can be specified. `id:*` matches all documents of the collection being searched. So the result will include the referenced documents if a reference exists otherwise the document will be returned as is.

### Filtering on null values in left joins

You can also filter for documents where the joined collection does not have matching records (equivalent to filtering on null values in SQL). This is done by using the `!` (not operator) at the beginning of the `filter_by` clause:

```json
{
  "searches": [
    {
      "collection": "items",
      "q": "*",
      "filter_by": "!$deny_list(user_id:=u11)",
      "exclude_fields": "$deny_list(*)"
    }
  ]
}
```

This query returns all items that are NOT in the deny_list for user `u11`.

**Note:** The `exclude_fields` parameter is important to prevent the deny list data from appearing in the search API response.

## Nested Joins

Typesense supports nesting joins for queries involving multiple data retrieval and filtering levels. Suppose we are managing the inventory of multiple retailers where a particular product can have many variants. The data could be modeled like this:

```json
{
  "name": "products",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "name", "type": "string" }
  ]
}
```
```json
{
  "name": "product_variants",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "title", "type": "string" },
    { "name": "price", "type": "float" },
    { "name": "product_id", "type": "string", "reference": "products.id" }
  ]
}
```
```json
{
  "name": "retailers",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "title", "type": "string" },
    { "name": "location", "type": "geopoint" }
  ]
}
```
```json
{
  "name": "inventory",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "qty", "type": "int32" },
    { "name": "retailer_id", "type": "string", "reference": "retailers.id" },
    { "name": "product_variant_id", "type": "string", "reference": "product_variants.id" }
  ]
}
```
Nested joins syntax follows `$JoinedCollectionName( $NestedJoinedCollectionName(...))` convention. To search through the product names and to get all the inventory of every retailer, the following query can be sent:

```json
{
  "collection": "products",
  "q": "shampoo",
  "query_by": "name",
  "filter_by": "$product_variants( $inventory( $retailers(id:*)))",
  "include_fields": "$product_variants(price, $inventory(qty, $retailers(title)))"
}
```

If we want to search for products within a geo radius, the following query can be sent:

```json
{
  "collection": "products",
  "q": "shampoo",
  "query_by": "name",
  "filter_by": "$product_variants( $inventory( $retailers(location:(48.87538726829884, 2.296113163780903,1 km))))",
  "include_fields": "$product_variants(price, $inventory(qty, $retailers(title)))"
}
```

If we also want to filter by price, the following query can be sent:

```json
{
  "collection": "products",
  "q": "shampoo",
  "query_by": "name",
  "filter_by": "$product_variants(price:<100 && $inventory( $retailers(location:(48.87538726829884, 2.296113163780903,1 km))))",
  "include_fields": "$product_variants(price, $inventory(qty, $retailers(title)))"
}
```

### Sort by a nested joined collection's field

Following the `$JoinedCollectionName( $NestedJoinedCollectionName(...))` convention, we can specify to sort_by on a field that's present in the nested joined collection this way:

```json
{
  "sort_by": "$JoinedCollectionName( $NestedJoinedCollectionName(field_name:desc))"
}
```
