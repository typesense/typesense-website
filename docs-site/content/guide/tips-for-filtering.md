# Tips for Filtering Data in Typesense

In this article, we'll talk about how to filter data in Typesense using various filtering options:

[[toc]]

## Basic Filtering

Typesense allows you to filter your search results based on the values of specific fields. You can
use the `filter_by` parameter to specify a custom filter string.

```json
{
  "q": "*",
  "filter_by": "country:=USA"
  // ...
}
```

Note that the base format for a filter is `field: <operator> <value>`. Every filter field must have
a **`:`** after it.

- :white_check_mark: Correct: `price:>=100`
- :x: Incorrect: `price>=100`

## Available Operators

| Operator  | Description              | Available types                             | Example                      |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `=`       | Equal to                 | `string`, `int32`, `int64`, `float`, `bool` | `country:=USA`               |
| `:`       | Partially equal to       | `string`                                    | `country:New`                |
| `>`       | Greater than             | `int32`, `int64`, `float`                   | `price:>100`                 |
| `<`       | Less than                | `int32`, `int64`, `float`                   | `price:<100`                 |
| `!=`      | Not equal to             | `string`, `int32`, `int64`, `float`, `bool` | `status:!=inactive`          |
| `<=`      | Less than or equal to    | `int32`, `int64`, `float`                   | `price:<=100`                |
| `>=`      | Greater than or equal to | `int32`, `int64`, `float`                   | `price:>=100`                |
| `[]`      | Is one of                | `string`, `int32`, `int64`, `float`, `bool` | `country:[USA, UK, Canada]`  |
| `![]`    | Is not any of             | `string`, `int32`, `int64`, `float`, `bool` | `country:![USA, UK, Canada]` |
| `[..]`    | Range                    | `int32`, `int64`, `float`                   | `price:[100..200]`           |

### Non-exact Operator for String Types

The non-exact operator (`:`) allows for **word-level** partial matching on `string` fields. It's useful when you want to find results that contain a specific word:

```shell
location:New
```

This filter will match any country name containing "New", such as:

- ✅ New Zealand
- ✅ New Caledonia
- ✅ Papua New Guinea

But it will NOT match a location like:

- ❌ `Newfoundland`

Since `New` is not a standalone word in the string `Newfoundland`. If you need this type of matching, see [Prefix Filtering](#prefix-filtering) below.

:::tip Performance Tip

The non-exact operator (`:`) doesn't take token position into account, so it is usually faster than the exact `:=` operator.

:::

### Array Operators

Array operators allow you to filter numeric fields (`int32`, `int64`, or `float`) based on specific conditions:

```shell
price:[<20, >100]
```

Will result in items with a price of:

- Under 20 `OR`
- Over 100

Commas act as OR operators, allowing flexible condition combinations.

#### The Range Operator

The range operator can be used with multiple array elements, creating a logical OR between ranges or values:

```shell
price:[100..200, 15..50, 800]
```

This matches items with prices:

- Between 100 and 200
- Between 15 and 50
- Exactly 800

## Filtering for Empty Fields

You may want to filter for records where a specific field is empty or null. 

Since Typesense doesn't allow an entirely empty filter value in `filter_by`, you can use placeholders instead.

One approach is to use an alphanumeric placeholder (like `~~`) when you want to find empty fields:

```json
{
  "q": "*",
  "filter_by": "optional_field:=~~"
}
```

To do this though, when indexing your data, you would need to:

1. Add your placeholder characters to the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/collections.html#schema-parameters`">`symbols_to_index`</RouterLink> parameter in the collection schema.
2. When adding documents, identify fields that might be empty and replace the empty or null values with your chosen placeholder (e.g., `~~`)

```js{4}
// Example preprocessing before indexing
const document = {
  title: "Product name",
  description: "~~", // Empty field
  category: "Electronics"
};
```

Then, to filter for records with empty descriptions:

```shell
filter_by = description:=~~
```

Similarly, to filter for records with non-empty descriptions, you can use the `!` operator:

```shell
filter_by = description:!~~
```

:::warning IMPORTANT Note about Placeholder Symbols

Symbols are not indexed by default in Typesense. 

So to make the above technique work, you would need to configure the `symbols_to_index` parameter for the specific field in your collection schema.

Here's how to set up your schema with `symbols_to_index`:

```json{5}
{
  "name": "products",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "title", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "description", "type": "string", "symbols_to_index": ["~"]},
    {"name": "category", "type": "string"}
  ]
}
```

By including the desired symbol in `symbols_to_index`, Typesense will properly index and allow filtering on that symbol. You can then use it as a placeholder for empty fields:

:::

## Prefix Filtering

> This feature is only available as of Typesense Server v27.0

You can use an asterisk (`*`) to denote a prefix in a `string` field filter. This allows you to filter for fields that **begin with** the provided prefix:

```shell
name:Jo*
```

This filter will return results for people whose names include a word starting with `Jo`, such as:

- Jonathan Jacobs
- John McKinley
- Michael Johansson

When you use the prefix in conjunction with the exact-match operator `:=`, the results will only include entries where the prefix matches the beginning of the name:

```shell
name:=Jo*
```

This will match:

- ✅ Jonathan Jacobs
- ✅ John McKinley

But not:

- ❌ Michael Johansson

## Boolean Operations

You can combine multiple filters using logical operators.

| Operator                  | Description | Example                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `&&`                      | Logical AND | `country:=USA && city:=New York`                       |
| <code>&#124;&#124;</code> | Logical OR  | <code>country:=USA &#124;&#124; country:=Canada</code> |

When using logical operators, you can use parentheses to group your filters.

For example, to filter for products that are either made in the USA or Canada, and are located in New York, you can use the following filter:

```shell
(country:=USA || country:=Canada) && city:=New York
```

This will return products that are either made in the USA or Canada, and are located in New York.
When using logical operators, you can use parentheses to group your filters.
For example, to filter for products that are either made in the USA or Canada, and are located in New York, you can use the following filter:

```shell
(country:=USA || country:=Canada) && city:=New York
```

### Operator Precedence

In boolean operations, the AND operator (`&&`) has higher precedence than the OR operator (`||`). This means that AND operations are performed before OR operations, unless parentheses are used to specify a different order.

For example:

```shell
country:=USA || country:=Canada && city:=New York
```

Would be interpreted as:

```shell
country:=USA || (country:=Canada && city:=New York)
```

To change the order of operations, use parentheses:

```shell
(country:=USA || country:=Canada) && city:=New York
```

## Filtering Array Types

Any of the array types can be used for filtering, matching any of their values.

For example, if there's a field called `department_prices` that's a `int32[]` and there's a document with `department_prices: [32, 60, 80]`,
then the filter of:

```shell
department_prices:<80
```

Would in turn return this document.

Subsequently, you can also use array operators:

```shell
deparment_prices:[20..80]
```

## Escaping special characters

If you want to filter for a value that includes special characters, such as a comma (`,`), you can use
backticks around your filter value:

```shell
country:=`United States, Minor Outlying Islands`
```

## Filtering Geopoints

You can filter on `geopoint` fields by searching either within a specific radius, or by specifying a bounding box.

For example, to filter for results within a 10 kilometer radius of a specific location, you can use the following filter:

```shell
location:(48.90615915923891, 2.3435897727061175, 10 km),
```

:::tip
You can use the same filter for miles by changing the distance unit to `mi`.
:::

Or, to filter for results within a bounding box, you can use the following filter:

```shell
location:(48.8662, 2.3255, 48.8581, 2.3209, 48.8561, 2.3448, 48.8641, 2.3469)
```
For information on filtering `geopoint` fields to search within a specific area, please refer to our <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/geosearch.html#searching-within-a-radius`">documentation</RouterLink> on Geosearch.

## Filtering Nested Object Fields

You can also filter on <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/collections.html#indexing-nested-fields`">nested object fields</RouterLink> by using the dot (`.`) notation to refer to nested fields.

For example, if you have a `customer` nested object inside your collection schema that looks like this:

```json{3}
{
  "customer": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "city": "Alpha",
    "dob": 964924500
  }
}
```

You can filter by the customer's name like:

```
customer.name:=John Doe
```

## Filtering Nested Array Objects

When filtering on fields inside nested array objects, you need to use a special syntax to ensure the filters are applied to the same object within the array. The syntax is: `<nested_field_parent>.{<filter_conditions>}`.

For example, consider a menu collection with the following schema:

```json
{
  "name": "menu",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "name", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "ingredients", "type": "object[]"},
    {"name": "ingredients.name", "type": "string[]"},
    {"name": "ingredients.concentration", "type": "int32[]"}
  ],
  "enable_nested_fields": true
}
```

And these sample records:

```json lines
{ 
  "name": "Pasta",
  "ingredients": [
    {"name": "cheese", "concentration": 40},
    {"name": "spinach", "concentration": 10},
    {"name": "jalepeno", "concentration": 20}
  ]
}
{
  "name": "Pizza",
  "ingredients": [
    {"name": "cheese", "concentration": 30},
    {"name": "pizza sauce", "concentration": 30},
    {"name": "olives", "concentration": 30}
  ]
}
{
  "name": "Lasagna",
  "ingredients": [
    {"name": "cheese", "concentration": 60},
    {"name": "jalepeno", "concentration": 20},
    {"name": "olives", "concentration": 20}
  ]
}
```

To filter for dishes that have cheese with concentration less than 50, use:

```shell
filter_by=ingredients.{name:=cheese && concentration:<50}
```

This will return only Pasta and Pizza, because it matches objects within the ingredients array where both conditions are true for the same object.

:::warning Important Note
The traditional filter syntax `ingredients.name:=cheese && ingredients.concentration:<50` would match all three records because it doesn't ensure the conditions apply to the same object in the array. Always use the `{...}` syntax when filtering on multiple fields within nested array objects.
:::

:::warning Important Note
Fields inside object[] fields automatically become arrays, that is the reason that ingredients.name and ingredients.concentration are arrays, despite being single fields.
:::

You can use any valid filter operators inside the `{...}` block.

For example:
```shell
# Find dishes with either high cheese concentration or jalepeno
filter_by=ingredients.{name:=cheese && concentration:>50} || ingredients.{name:=jalepeno}

# Find dishes with cheese concentration between 30 and 50
filter_by=ingredients.{name:=cheese && concentration:[30..50]}
```

## Filtering Joined Collections

When filtering for joined collection, you use the `$CollectionName(<filter>)` syntax.

For example, if you have a `products` collection with a `category` field and a `categories` collection with a `name` field, you can filter for products that are in the `Electronics` category like this:

```shell
$categories(name:=Electronics)
```

Inside of the joined collection, you can use any filter string that you would use directly for that
collection, including `&&`, `||` and `!` boolean operators. For example, to filter on products in
the Electronics category AND the `Mobile` category, but NOT in the `Disposable` category, and
under $100, you can use the following filter:

```shell
$categories(name:=Electronics && name:=Mobile && name:!=Disposable) && price:<100
```

Filtering on joined fields is supported at any level of nesting. For a detailed explanation and examples, please refer to our <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/joins.html#nested-joins`">documentation on nested joins</RouterLink>.

:::warning
Joins must be configured in the schema prior to using them in a filter.
