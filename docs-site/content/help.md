# Help

If you run into any issues or have general questions, here are a couple of ways to ask for help:

- Read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](/guide/faqs.md) or browse through the nav bar on the left-pane in our [Guide](/guide/README.md) for relevant articles - we've put these articles together based on feedback from several users.
- Use GitHub's native search to search through past conversations in our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Atypesense++issues&type=issues).
- Browse and search through [past conversations](https://threads.typesense.org/) in our Slack community. 
- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/typesense/typesense/issues) with any questions or bug reports.
- Join our public [Slack community](https://typesense.link/slack-community) to discuss general questions and/or issues.
- We also offer prioritized paid support, with private Slack, email & phone-based support with guaranteed SLAs on Typesense Cloud. Learn more [here](https://cloud.typesense.org/support-plans).
