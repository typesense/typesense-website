# Why Typesense?

Our goal with Typesense is to reduce the time-to-market for building a great instant-search experience that provides relevant results out of the box.

To this end, we've designed every feature from the ground up, with a close eye on making it intuitive and easy to use.
We've also provided the same defaults for every configuration parameter, so the engine works out of the box for a majority of use cases. This is what we mean by "batteries-included".

We hope that this increases developer productivity significantly when developing search experiences - one less thing for you to worry about.
